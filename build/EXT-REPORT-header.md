> INSTRUCTIONS: Go through the steps to download and attempt a replication. Document your steps here, the errors generated, and the steps you took to alleviate those errors. This includes apparently minor steps, such as adjusting directories, or installing packages, any deviations from the README. If the README did not specify a certain step or action, describe why you chose that action, and whether it should be detailed in the README. All figures and tables should be evident once you are done, i.e., saved to disk. If this is not done in code, please add code to do so.
