# Sample Language that may be used in the REPLICATION report

The following fragments may be used when reporting back on success or failure of a reproduction attempt. They usually identify lack of some key component. They should be added to the completed [REPLICATION.md](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)

## Decisions

### the one you want to hear

**The replication package is accepted.**

### There might be some suggestions, but no requirements. Then the following section can be added.

If you wish to follow up on our suggestions, please follow [instructions on how to unlock/recall your replication package](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/FAQ.html#you-can-recall-the-submission). Otherwise, no further action is required.

### the one almost as good during conditional acceptance

**Conditional on making the requested changes to the openICPSR deposit prior to publication, the replication package is accepted.**

(This means the author must still make a few changes to the openICPSR deposit, but the paper will be marked "accepted, forthcoming")


### the one is a bit more work at conditional acceptance

**Conditional on making the requested changes to the manuscript and the openICPSR deposit prior to publication, the replication package is accepted.**


(This means the author must still make a few changes to the openICPSR deposit, AND there are changes to the paper, but typically, these changes can be made to the paper during copy-editing, and the paper will be marked "accepted, forthcoming")

### A warning which sometimes needs to be made explicit

There are quite a few items that still need resolution. However, we are confident that you will be able to address these issues in a timely fashion prior to publication of the manuscript. We note that the openICPSR deposit will not be in compliance with our policy until these items have been addressed.

### For R&R that are mostly good to go:

**We look forward to reviewing the final replication package again after conditional acceptance.**

**The actions required to bring the package into conformance are simple enough, we do not need to see the package again until Conditional Acceptance.**

## Info for summary

> The article uses restricted-access data. Access to the data cannot be obtained in a timely fashion, a reproduction is not attempted. The report contains information on data description, and identifies whether all tables and figures can be identified in the code. 

> Thank you for your replication archive. In assessing compliance with our [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code), we have identified the following issues, which we ask you to address:

> Due to insufficient time available to the replicator, only a partial replication was completed. Thus, the report contains information on data description, identifies whether all tables and figures can be identified in the code, and notes the replication results of the partial replication.

> The replication package is accepted, pending one issue which can be addressed during copy-editing prior to publication. Since this only affects the README/code deposit/online appendix, this requires no further re-submission to Manuscript Central - a note will be added to the openICPSR repo, and publication is contingent on making the change.

> [NOTE] We are currently exploring expanded ways to highlight and facilitate reader-interaction with the computational code of an article. Your replication package seems to be compatible with our options. Please contact the AEA Data Editor if you are interested in this option (dataeditor@aeapubs.org).


## Temporary language

At the end of each summary, please include the following line:

> The openICPSR submission process has changed. If you have not already done so, please "Change Status -> Submit to AEA" from your deposit Workspace.

## README

> [SUGGESTED] A recommended README template for replication packages in economics can be found on the [Social Science Data Editor Github site](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/template-README.html).

## IRB

> [REQUIRED] The data collection reported in this article seems to have required IRB approval. Please provide IRB approval information in the titlepage footnote.

> [REQUIRED] The data collection reported in this article had IRB approval. Please provide full IRB approval information, including protocol number and home institution of the IRB, in the titlepage footnote.

> [REQUIRED] The data collection reported in this article had IRB approval. Please provide full IRB approval information, including protocol number, in the titlepage footnote.

## Experiment conducted


Experimental instructions
-------------------------

The deposit does not seem to contain the required software/scripts to implement the experiment, though the appendix provides a complete verbose description thereof. As per the AEA's [Policy for Papers Conducting Experiments and Collecting Primary Data](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-experimental), please

> [REQUIRED] Provide any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment or develop the survey instrument, e.g., z-Tree code, Qualtrics, and LimeSurvey.


## If no ICPSR deposit

> [REQUIRED] We note that you provided data during the R&R phase through Dropbox. When the paper is conditionally accepted, your code will need to be uploaded to openICPSR. Please preserve the same directory structure as we observed in this round. Import all ZIP files, unless discussed/authorized otherwise by the Data Editor. Please follow [our guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html#checklist).

## When there is no ICPSR deposit because there is a CodeOcean capsule

> [REQUIRED] Suggested language (for title footnote): "Data and code for this article can be found at AUTHORS (2022a), and a compute capsule is available at AUTHORS (2022b)." where AUTHORS (2022a) points to the openICPSR deposit DOI, and AUTHORS (2022b) points to the CodeOcean capsule.

(note also that presently, the content of the CodeOcean capsule should be mirrored to openICPSR)

## Relative to the openICPSR deposit

> [REQUIRED] Several required metadata elements are missing from the openICPSR deposit. Please consult our [additional deposit guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html)

> [SUGGESTED] Several suggested metadata elements are missing from the openICPSR deposit. Please consult our [additional deposit guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html)

> [REQUIRED]  ZIP files should be uploaded to openICPSR via "Import from ZIP" instead of "Upload Files" (there should be no ZIP files visible, except in rare approved circumstances). Please delete the ZIP files, and re-upload using the "Import from ZIP" function.

> [STRONGLY SUGGESTED] Please add the Github repository, or its archived equivalent, as a "Related Publication"

> [REQUIRED]  Please delete the `__MACOS` directory
    
> [REQUIRED]   Please delete empty directories
    
> [REQUIRED]   Please delete any redundant (obsolete) files

> [SUGGESTED] Please ensure that the README is in the root directory, and that unnecessary directory levels are pruned from the repository.

When authors are redistributing data or code from other authors that is not published and was obtained via personal correspondence. 

> [REQUIRED] Please create a "LICENSE" file in the repository, collecting the various permissions and licenses. A simple concatenation is fine. Paraphrasing is fine. Providing copies of the email correspondence in addition to the LICENSE file is fine. 

An example of a license file might start as follows:

```
Permission to redistribute data from Bateman and Munro (2005) was granted by Ian Bateman on May 26, 2019.

```

When there is evidence of a differing license in the deposit, there must be a "LICENSE.txt" file present.

> [REQUIRED] Please create a separate file called "LICENSE.txt" and add the text from the bottom of the README. This is necessary to let openICPSR recognize that the deposit is not subject to the standard CC-BY license.

### When the only changes are needed are code/data

> Details in the full report, which you will receive via Manuscript Central shortly. The manuscript is accepted, the author should address the remaining issue in the openICPSR repository. Once completed, do not resubmit to Manuscript Central. Please use the openICPSR Project Communication log, specifying AEAREP-xxx.
